    description: "The BYD Atto 3 (known as the Yuan Plus in China) is a compact all-electric crossover SUV built on BYD's dedicated e-platform 3.0. It features a distinctive exterior design with sharp character lines, a closed-off front grille, connected LED light bars, and flush door handles for improved aerodynamics. Powered by BYD's proprietary Blade Battery technology with LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry, it's available with either a 50.1 kWh or 60.5 kWh battery pack delivering a WLTP range of up to 261 miles (420 km) in the extended range version. A front-mounted electric motor produces 201 HP (150 kW) and 310 Nm of torque, enabling 0-62 mph (0-100 km/h) acceleration in around 7.3 seconds. The interior is notable for its unique design elements including fitness-inspired door pulls, a rotating 12.8-inch central touchscreen that can switch between portrait and landscape orientations, and quirky details like guitar string-inspired door pocket dividers. Standard technology includes wireless smartphone integration, voice control, and a comprehensive suite of driver assistance features. The Atto 3 represents BYD's global expansion strategy, being one of the first models introduced to numerous international markets including Europe, Australia, and parts of Southeast Asia as the Chinese manufacturer seeks to establish itself as a significant player in the worldwide EV market."
