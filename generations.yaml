    description: "The BYD Atto 3 (marketed as Yuan Plus in China and Latin America) is a battery electric compact crossover SUV built on BYD's dedicated e-Platform 3.0. Production began in January 2022. The vehicle features a distinctive design with sharp character lines, a closed-off front grille, connected LED light bars, and flush door handles for aerodynamics. It is powered by BYD's proprietary Blade Battery technology with LFP (lithium iron phosphate) chemistry, available with either a 49.92 kWh or 60.48 kWh battery pack. A front-mounted permanent magnet synchronous electric motor produces 150 kW (201 HP) standard power and 310 Nm of torque, enabling 0-100 km/h acceleration in approximately 7.3 seconds. The vehicle features a rotating 12.8-inch (or optional 15.6-inch from 2024) central infotainment touchscreen based on Android that can switch between portrait and landscape orientations, fitness-inspired interior design elements, and comprehensive driver assistance features. The Atto 3 was first showcased in August 2021 at the Chengdu Auto Show and officially released in February 2022 in China. It represents BYD's global expansion strategy, being introduced to multiple international markets including Europe, Australia, Japan, Southeast Asia, and beyond as BYD establishes itself in the worldwide EV market."
